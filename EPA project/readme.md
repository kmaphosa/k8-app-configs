# DevOps Engineer Assessment Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a DevOps pipeline, infrastructure-as-code principles, and continuous delivery using Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and Nginx. It also includes an observability stack for monitoring, logging, and alerting. The overall objective is to showcase a performant, secure, and highly available platform that meets the assessment criteria.

## Project Overview

### Key Features
- **ArgoCD for Continuous Delivery**: Automated deployment and synchronization of applications with GitOps principles.
- **Kubernetes-Based Platform**: Deployment of Nginx and WordPress services with Kubernetes manifests.
- **Ingress Management**: Centralized traffic routing with Nginx Ingress controllers.
- **Observability Stack**: Elasticsearch, Kibana, Metricbeat, and Filebeat for monitoring and alerting.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool for automating builds and deployments.

Deployment Instructions
Prerequisites
Kubernetes Cluster: Make sure you have access to a running Kubernetes cluster.
Kubectl: Kubernetes command-line tool installed.
ArgoCD: Installed and accessible.
GitHub Repository: Set up with this project's configuration.
Steps
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Set Up ArgoCD:
Apply the application.yaml file in the react-nginx directory to your ArgoCD instance.
Deploy the Applications:
Apply the Kubernetes manifests for Nginx and WordPress:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f react-nginx/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f react-nginx/service.yaml
kubectl apply -f wordpress/mysql-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f wordpress/wordpress-deployment.yaml
Configure Ingress:
Apply the Ingress resources for routing traffic:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f elk-argocd-ingress.yaml
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
Configure Monitoring:
Deploy Metricbeat and Filebeat using the provided Helm charts or values files:
bash
Copy code
helm install metricbeat -f monitoring/metricbeat-values.yaml elastic/metricbeat
helm install filebeat -f monitoring/filebeat-values.yaml elastic/filebeat
Access the Services:
Ensure DNS or /etc/hosts entries point to the correct domains like elk.local and argocd.local.
Access the services via the respective URLs:
Kibana: http://elk.local
ArgoCD: http://argocd.local
